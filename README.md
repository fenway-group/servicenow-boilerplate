ServiceNow Boilerplate
======================
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript boilerplate for modern, dynamic, and responsive ServiceNow CMS and web applications.


Goals
--------------
The primary aim of the ServiceNow Boilerplate is to give you a jump-start on your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript development while allowing you develop, test, and debug your ServiceNow app or CMS site on your local machine with as little friction as possible. 

The general workflow is envisioned as follows:
 - Develop HTML, CSS, and JavaScript locally (running on a local webserver like Apache or mongoose)
 - When ready to deploy:
 	- copy HTML files to UI pages
 	- copy CSS to Style Sheets ()


This workflow will improve productivity by allowing SN developers to:
 - Develop collaboratively without breaking others (via a version control tool like git)
 - Use local development tools to improve productivity (get syntax highlighting, quick/easy saves and tabs back!)



Prerequisites
--------------
ServiceNow Boilerplate assumes that you are using the Accelerator for Web Apps (AWA)
(available on Share here: http://j.mp/1qdBTIL) and that you pick Bootstrap as your CSS Framework and AngularJS as your JavaScript framework
